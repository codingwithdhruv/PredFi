If the release is only for certain consoles (e.g. Xbox Series X/S) it will count.\n\nThe resolution source will be official information from Rockstar Games or its parent company, Take-Two Interactive; however a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.",

    "description": "This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if the Fully Diluted Valuation of Variational's token is greater than the value specified in the title 1 day after launch. Otherwise, the market will resolve to \"No.\"\n\nThe token must be actively and publicly transferable and tradable.\n\nThe token must be fungible, meaning all units of the token are identical and interchangeable. Examples of qualifying fungible token standards include:\n\n- ERC-20 or compatible/derivative standards on any EVM-compatible chain\n- SPL / SPL Token-2022 standard on Solana\n- Native blockchain tokens (e.g., a project's own Layer 1 chain coin)\n- Equivalent fungible token standards on other blockchains\n\nNon-fungible tokens such as ERC-1155 tokens will not qualify for this market.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be information from Variational, however a consensus of credible reporting will also be used.\n\nThe FDV will be determined using the total token supply multiplied by the token price.\n\n\"1 day after launch\" is defined as 4:00 PM ET on the calendar day following launch. The resolution source for this market is the most liquid price source available. If Variational doesn't launch a token by December 31, 2027, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"No\".",
